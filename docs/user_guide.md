Kbin is a decentralized content aggregator and microblogging platform running on the Fediverse network. It can
communicate with many other ActivityPub services, including Mastodon, Lemmy, Pleroma, Peertube.

The initiative aims to promote a free and open internet.

## Introduction

The platform is divided into thematic categories called magazines. By default, any user can create their own magazine
and automatically become its owner. Then they receive many administrative tools that will help them personalize
and moderate the magazine, including appointing moderators from among other users.

Content from the Fediverse is also cataloged based on groups or tags. A registered user can follow magazines, other
users or domains and create his own personalized homepage. There is also the option to block unwanted topics.

Content can be posted on the main page - external links and more relevant articles or on microblog section - aggregating
short posts. All content can additionally be categorized and labeled. Great possibilities to search for interesting
topics and people easily is something that distinguishes Kbin.

The platform is equally suitable for a small personal instance for friends and family, a school or university community,
company platform or a general instance with thousands of active users.
